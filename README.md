### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm deeply involved in Operations Research, with a keen focus on Scheduling.
- ðŸŒ± I'm exploring AIGC, MILP, coffee brewing, baking, dancing, and photography (Jack of all trades, master of none~).
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm seeking collaborators for OR competitions, emotionally stable and academic-minded individuals, or those who love fun and cute aspects of life.
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking to disprove predictions for '2062' about 2031.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me anything, though it's best to keep an open mind.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Still deciding if I should share (might create a new one later).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: The most important thing in life is to be happy.
